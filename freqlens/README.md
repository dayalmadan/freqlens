# FreqLens

FreqLens is a Python-based audio analysis and comparison tool designed to help you analyze and compare two audio tracks, such as your own music vs. a professional reference track. It provides detailed insights into different frequency bands, RMS, peak levels, and dominant frequencies.

## Features

- Normalize loudness between two tracks for accurate comparison
- Analyze specific frequency bands (e.g., sub-bass, bass, midrange, upper mids, highs)
- Calculate RMS and peak values for each frequency band
- Identify dominant and least dominant frequencies in each band
- Compare audio tracks across multiple frequency bands
